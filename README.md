# RELATIONAL DATABASES
Are pieces of software that let you make an operational system out of an ERD.Relational entities correspond to database tables and entity attributes respond to table columns.
To pull data from relational database table,you perform a query.You compose queries using a programming language called structured query language(sql).
Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.

-Structured
-Tables are connected to each other
-Structure ensures data consistency
-Security
-Easy back up and recovery
NON-RELATIONAL
-Key value database
-One key that ties to one value
-Column store 
-Document store
-flexible and cost effective

# DATA USE CASES
 Have two major categories of data processing:
# 1.Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)
-OLTP systems handles the transactions we encounter everyday eg flight reservation,ordering something online
-OLTP system balances the ability to write and read data efficiently
-OLTP databases are in 3NF
-Can use relational database technology

# 2.Online Analytical Processing(OLAP)
-OLAP systems focus on the ability of organizations to analyze data
-OLAP systems have a denormalized design
-Can use retional database technology
