# RELATIONAL DATABASES
Are pieces of software that let you make an operational system out of an ERD.Relational entities correspond to database tables and entity attributes respond to table columns.
To pull data from relational database table,you perform a query.You compose queries using a programming language called structured query language(sql).
Foreign keys enforce referential integrity.

RELATIONAL DATABASES
-Structured
-Tables are connected to each other
-Structure ensures data consistency
-Security
-Easy back up and recovery
NON-RELATIONAL
-Key value database
-One key that ties to one value
-Column store 
-Document store
-flexible and cost effective

# DATA USE CASES
 Have two major categories of data processing:
# 1.Online Transactional Processing(OLTP)
-OLTP systems handles the transactions we encounter everyday eg flight reservation,ordering something online
-OLTP system balances the ability to write and read data efficiently
-OLTP databases are in 3NF
-Can use relational database technology

# 2.Online Analytical Processing(OLAP)
-OLAP systems focus on the ability of organizations to analyze data
-OLAP systems have a denormalized design
-Can use retional database technology

# Descriptive Statistics
Branch of statistics that summarizes and describes data.
-Use descriptive statistics as measures to help you understand the characteristics of your dataset
MEASURE OF FREQUENCY
-helps you understand how often something happens.
COUNT
-understanding how much data you're working with,the total  number of observations is a frequently performed task.
PERCENTAGE
-is a frequency measure that identifies the proportion of a given value for a variable with respect to the total number of rows in a dataset.
FREQUENCY
-describes how often a specific value for a variable occurs in a dataset.
# Measure of central tendency
-is used to identify the central or most typical,value in a dataset.
WAYS TO MEASURE CENTRAL TENDENCY
1.Mean/average is measurement of central tendency that computes the arithmetic average for a given set of numeric values.
2.Median identifies the midpoint value for all observations of a variiable
3.Mode is a variable most frequently occuring observation,is more applicable when working with categorical data.
5 COMMON MEASURES OF DISPERSION
1.Range is the difference between maximum and minimum values
